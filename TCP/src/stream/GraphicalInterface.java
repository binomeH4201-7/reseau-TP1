Otherwise, if you want to code by hand and do not want to use GroupLayout, then GridBagLayout is recommended as the next most flexible and powerful layout manager.\n" +

As the box layout arranges components, it takes the components' alignments and minimum, preferred, and maximum sizes into account. In this section, we will talk about top-to-bottom layout. The same concepts apply to left-to-right or right-to-left layout. You simply substitute X for Y, height for width, and so on.\n" +

Instead, you specified X_AXIS (left to right) or Y_AXIS (top to bottom) when creating the BoxLayout. Our examples now use the constants LINE_AXIS and PAGE_AXIS, which are preferred because they enable programs to adjust to languages that have different orientations.

If the vertical space of the layout does not match the sum of the preferred heights, then BoxLayout tries to resize the components to fill the space. The components either grow or shrink to fill the space, with BoxLayout honoring the minimum and maximum sizes of each of the components. Any extra space appears at the bottom of the container.\n" +
